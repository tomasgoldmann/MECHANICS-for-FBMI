    "> Periodic motion is a type of motion in which a body or system returns to the same state after a certain period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time required for one complete repetition of the motion is called **period** and is usually denoted by the letter $T$. The symbol $P$ is not used because it could be confused with momentum. One complete repetition of the motion is called **cycle**.\n",
    "The unit of period in the **SI system** is the second **(s)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, periodic motion can be described by the function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x(t+T)=x(t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where where $x(t)$ represents the position describing the motion at time $t$\n",

    "### Frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Frequency** is defined as the number of cycles per unit time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is usually denoted by the Latin letter $f$ or the Greek letter $\\nu$ (*ni*). Period and frequency are **reciprocal quantities**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f = \\frac{1}{T}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a newborn's heart beats at **120 beats per minute**, then its period (the time between two beats) is **0.5 seconds**. In general, **a higher frequency corresponds to a shorter period** and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **SI system**, the unit of frequency is **hertz (Hz)**, named after the German physicist Heinrich Hertz. **1 Hz** means that a given event repeats **once per second**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For rotating devices, the traditional unit **revolutions per minute (RPM)** is often used:\n",

    "\n",
    "$$x(t) = A \\cos \\left(\\omega t + \\varphi_0 \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",

    "\n",
    "### Angular frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "Periodic motion is often better described by **angular frequency**, which is denoted by the Greek letter $\\omega$ (*omega*). Angular frequency represents **angular displacement per unit time** (for example, during rotation) or the rate of change of phase of a sinusoidal signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "## Relationship between harmonic motion and circular motion\n",
    "\n",
    "Harmonic motion can be understood as the **projection of circular motion** into one of its coordinate directions. Let us imagine a mass point that moves **uniformly around a circle** with an angular velocity $\\omega$. Its position can be described using parametric equations:\n",
