    "# Stress in thin-walled vessels\n",
    "\n",
    "Laplace's equation for thin-walled vessels describes the relationship between the internal pressure $p$, the radius of curvature of the vessel, and the stress in the vessel wall. This relationship is important in biomechanics (e.g., for modeling blood vessels), mechanical engineering, and materials engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial division of tasks is done according to the ratio of wall thickness to the total size of the vessel. If the smallest internal radius of curvature of the vessel $R_{min}$ and the wall thickness $t$ are indicated, we can indicate\n",
    "* $\\frac{R_{min}}{t} < 10$ - we are talking about thin-walled vessels\n",
    "* $\\frac{R_{min}}{t} > 10$ - we are talking about thick-walled vessels\n",
    "\n",
    "For thin-walled vessels, we do not need the inner and outer radii, but the average radius is sufficient for the calculation. Due to the small wall thickness, the stress in thin-walled vessels is considered to be planar (biaxial), even though the pressure p acts on the inner surface. Since the occurrence of shear stresses in the wall is not considered, the two arising stresses will be the main stresses of the considered stress, which is also called membrane.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will consider only **thin-walled vessels**. The issue of stress in thick-walled vessels goes beyond the scope of our course. Let us assume a vessel with two main radii of curvature $R_1$ and $R_2$ (they lie in two mutually perpendicular planes that correspond to the directions of the main stress, these are the so-called main curvatures), a wall thickness $t$ and an internal pressure $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**note**\n",
    ">\n",
    ">For thin-walled vessels, we do not need to consider the inner and outer radii, because $t\\ll R_1,E_2$. Due to the small wall thickness, the stress in thin-walled vessels is considered to be planar (biaxial), even if the pressure $p$ acts on the inner surface. Since the occurrence of shear stresses in the wall is not considered, the two arising stresses will be directly the principal stresses of the considered stress, which is also called **membrane stress**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between the stress in the wall and the shape of the vessel is referred to as the **Young-Laplace equation**. This equation was derived approximately simultaneously by **Thomas Young (1804)** and **Simon Pierre de Laplace (1805)**. A brief derivation of this equation is given below."
