    "# Dimensioning of components under tension and compression\n",
    "\n",
    "The dimensioning of components under tension and compression is carried out so that the component is able to safely transmit a given load without plastic deformation or fracture. The main criteria are **mechanical strength of the material**, **safety factor** and **limit states of the component**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dimensioning principles\n",
    "\n",
    "Two basic methods are used when dimensioning components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load dimensioning** – we determine the maximum permissible force that the component can transmit.\n",
    "2. **Cross-section dimensioning** – we design the corresponding cross-section of the component so that at a given force the stress does not exceed the permissible value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Load dimensioning**\n",
    "\n",
    "Force dimensioning consists in determining the maximum permissible force $F_{\\text{max}}$ that the component can withstand without failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the basic equation for normal stress:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma = \\frac{N}{A}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $\\sigma$ is the normal stress \\[Pa\\],\n",
    "- $N$ is the applied internal force \\[N\\],\n",
    "- $A$ is the cross-sectional area of ​​the component \\[m²\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum allowable force is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "N_{\\text{max}} = \\sigma_\\text{dov} A\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\sigma_{\\text{dov}}$ is the allowable stress of the material, which depends on the strength of the material and the safety factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Caution**\n",
    ">\n",
    ">In the case of variable load and cross-section along the length of the member, all parts must satisfy the strength condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Sizing by cross-section**\n",
    "\n",
    "When sizing by cross-section, we determine the required cross-sectional area $A_{\\text{min}}$, which ensures that the allowable stress is not exceeded when a given force is applied:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{N}{\\sigma_{\\text{dov}}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The selected cross-section must be large enough for the component to be safely stressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Safety factor\n",
    "\n",
    "> The safety factor $K$ is the ratio between the ultimate strength of the material and the actual or allowable stress:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> $$K = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{mez}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{dov}}}$$\n",
    ">\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $\\sigma_{\\text{mez}}$ is the strength limit of the material (yield limit or ultimate strength),\n",
    "- $\\sigma_{\\text{dov}}$ is the allowable stress at which the component should not fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "The safety factor takes into account uncertainties in the design, for example:\n",
    "- manufacturing tolerances,\n",
    "- variability of material properties,\n",
    "- dynamic loading and material fatigue,\n",
    "- safety requirements in service.\n",
    "\n",
    "The allowable stress is determined according to the relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma_{\\text{dov}} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{mez}}}{K}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The higher the safety factor, the more conservative the design, but at the same time leads to more robust and heavier components."
