    "# Example - Yo-Yo Dynamics\n",

    "\n",
    "A yo-yo of mass $m$ has an axis of radius $b$ and a spool of radius $R$. Its moment of inertia about the center can be taken as $I_{\\text{cm}} = \\frac{1}{2} m R^2$, and the thickness of the string can be neglected. The yo-yo is released from rest. Assume that the center of mass of the yo-yo is falling vertically and the string is vertical as it unwinds. Determine the force in the string as the yo-yo falls?\n",
    "\n",
    "As the yo-yo falls, it rotates clockwise. The torque about the center of mass of the yo-yo is caused by the force in the string and increases the magnitude of the angular velocity. The string determines the $y$ direction, the $x$ axis is horizontal, and the direction of the torque is in the negative $z$ direction. Let's use the right-hand rule or the vector definition of torque:\n",

    "$$\\vec{M}_{\\text{cm}} = \\vec{r}_{\\text{cm},T} \\times \\vec{T}$$\n",

    "$$\\vec{r}_{\\text{cm},T} = -b \\vec{i}, \\quad \\vec{T} = T \\vec{j}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So the torque is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{M}_{\\text{cm}} = (-b \\hat{i}) \\times (T \\hat{j}) = -bT \\vec{k}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's use Newton's second law in the direction $-\\vec{j} $:\n",

    "$$T - mg = m a_y$$\n",

    "where $a_y$ is the vertical acceleration of the Yo-Yo.\n",

    "Let's use the rotational equation of motion for the Yo-Yo:\n",
