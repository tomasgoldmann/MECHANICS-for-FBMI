    "We derive the equations of the angeled throw using the Lagrange-Euler equations.\n",

    "Consider a projectile of mass $m$ moving in a 2D plane (x, y) under the influence of gravity $g$. The Lagrangian approach uses generalized coordinates, which in this case are simply the Cartesian coordinates *x* and *y*.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Kinetic energy (Ek):** The kinetic energy of the projectile is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_k = \\frac{1}{2}m(\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\dot{x}$ and $\\dot{y}$ are the time derivatives of *x* and *y* (i.e., the velocities in the x and y directions).\n",
    "* **Potential Energy (U):** The potential energy of a projectile due to gravity is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U = mgy$$\n",

    "* The Lagrangian is defined as the difference between kinetic and potential energy:\n",

    "$$m\\ddot{x} - 0 = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ddot{x} = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation means that the acceleration in the x direction is zero, which implies a constant velocity.\n",

    "$$m\\ddot{y} + mg = 0$$\n",

    "$$\\ddot{y} = -g$$\n",
