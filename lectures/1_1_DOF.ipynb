    "For a body to be in static equilibrium, all possible motions must be adequately constrained. If the degrees of freedom are not constrained, the body is in an unstable state and can move freely in one or more ways. Stability is highly desirable for safety reasons, and bodies are often constrained by **redundant constraints**, so that even if one fails, the body would still remain stable. If the constraints are interpreted correctly, then equal numbers of constraints and degrees of freedom create a stable system, and the values ​​of the reaction forces and moments can be determined using the equations of equilibrium. If the number of constraints exceeds the number of degrees of freedom, the body is in equilibrium, but you will need techniques that go beyond the equations of equilibrium in statics to determine the reactions.\n",
