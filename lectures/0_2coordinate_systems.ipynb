    "# Coordinate systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Motion (change of position in space over time) is not an absolute concept; we need a reference point relative to which we describe the movement of an object. Likewise, the state of this reference cannot be absolute in space, and therefore motion is relative.\n",
    "\n",
    "A reference frame is a place relative to which we choose to describe the motion of an object. In this reference frame, we define a coordinate system (set of axes) in which we measure the motion of an object (but the terms reference frame and coordinate system are often used interchangeably).\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of a reference frame and a coordinate system is often a matter of judgment and practicality. However, there is an important distinction between reference frames when we are dealing with the dynamics of motion, where we are interested in the forces associated with the motion of an object. In dynamics, we speak of an inertial frame (also known as a Galilean frame) when Newton's laws of motion in their simplest form apply in that frame, and a non-inertial frame (also known as a non-inertial reference frame) when Newton's laws in their simplest form do not apply (apparent accelerations/forces appear in such a frame). An inertial frame is at rest or moving at a constant velocity (since there is no such thing as absolute rest!), while a non-inertial frame is accelerated (relative to an inertial frame).\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of a frame of reference has changed significantly since the days of Aristotle, Galileo, Newton, and Einstein. You can read more about this and the philosophical implications in the article [Space and Time: Inertial Frames]( http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spacetime-iframes/).\n",

    "## Coordinate system base\n",
    "\n",
    "**The base of a coordinate system** is a set of vectors that allow us to uniquely describe the position of any point in space. Think of it as a set of axes that intersect at a single point (the origin) and determine the directions in which we measure distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why do we need a base?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Unambiguous description of position:** Thanks to the base, we can uniquely identify each point in space using coordinates that indicate how far this point is from the origin in the direction of each axis.\n",
    "* **Simplification of calculations:** The base allows us to convert geometric problems into algebraic ones, which makes them much easier to solve.\n",
    "* **Standardization:** The base provides us with a common language for describing spatial relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What does the base look like?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **In a plane:** The base is formed by two linearly independent vectors that determine the direction of the x and y axes. The most commonly used is the Cartesian coordinate system, where the x and y axes are perpendicular to each other and have the same unit.\n",
    "   \n",
    "* **In space:** The base consists of three linearly independent vectors that determine the direction of the x, y, and z axes. Again, the Cartesian coordinate system is most often used, where the axes are mutually perpendicular and have the same unit.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "**Base features:**\n",
    "* **Linear independence:** No base vector must be a linear combination of the other base vectors.\n",

    "## Orthogonal and orthonormal bases\n",
    "\n",
    "An **orthogonal base** is a special type of base for a vector space where all vectors are perpendicular to each other. This means that the dot product of any two distinct vectors in that base is equal to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is an orthogonal base advantageous?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Simpler calculations:** Many calculations, such as projecting vectors or finding the coordinates of a vector relative to a base, are significantly simpler for orthogonal bases.\n",
    "* **Geometric interpretation:** Orthogonality of vectors has a direct geometric interpretation - the vectors form a right angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **orthonormal base** is an even more special case of an orthogonal base. In addition to all vectors in this base being mutually perpendicular, they also have unit length (i.e. their magnitude is equal to one).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is an orthonormal base advantageous?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Normalization:** Unit length of vectors simplifies many calculations, especially when working with norms and distances.\n",
    "* ** Orthogonality:* * Preserves all the advantages of an orthogonal base.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of bases**\n",
    "* **Cartesian base:** The most common type of base, where the axes are perpendicular to each other and have the same unit.\n",
    "* **Spherical base:** Used to describe the position of points in spherical coordinates (radius, angle in the horizontal plane, angle from the vertical).\n",
    "* **Cylindrical base:** Used to describe the position of points in cylindrical coordinates (radius, angle, height).\n",

The orthogonality of the Cartesian coordinate system is convenient for its use in classical mechanics, it is usually assumed that the structure of space has a [Cartesian coordinate system]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system) and, as a result, motions in different directions are independent of each other.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. The first axis, $\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{v }}_ 1$, the vector $\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{m}}_2-\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{m}}_1$ (or any other vector difference);\n",

In motion analysis, this coordinate system is the coordinate system from the motion capture system and is determined in the calibration phase. In this phase, the positions of markers placed on the object with perpendicular axes and known distances between markers are captured and used as a reference (laboratory) coordinate system.\n",
